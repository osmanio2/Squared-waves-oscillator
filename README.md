# Squared-waves-oscillator
This is a very basic wave-generator/oscillator circuit (It generates only square-liked waves) and a plot of the graph it generates on a PC using Arduino Uno.
The circuit components are only an op-amp 741, a capacitor and 5 resistors. 
I used Arduino platform(C/C++) to code the arduino (two lines of code only) and Processing library(Java) to plot the the graph.
